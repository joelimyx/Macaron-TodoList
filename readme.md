## Prototype 
Before I started anything, I drew some prototype as to how my Todo List would work before I started coding. Initially I was thinking of putting all the button on one side. But after a few testing with different layout, I ultimately  did change up some design aspect when I was doing the actual testing.

## Not included / statisfied
### Data persistence 
I couldn't get the app to store data. I've tried shared preference, but the object just would not store the data.

### Detail and title alignment 
The title looks offset when the detail text is empty

### Button alignment 
This is still a work in progress. Things aren't exactly in position or seems offset.
